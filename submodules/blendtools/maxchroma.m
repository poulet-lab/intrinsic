function C=maxchroma(mode,varargin)
%   MAXCHROMA(MODEL,{CHANNELS})
%       returns the maximum chroma for color points to stay within sRGB gamut
%       can be used for chroma normalization (HuSL/HSY) or truncation prior to conversion
%
%   MODEL specifies the color model to use
%       'ypp' uses polar YPbPr
%       'luv' uses CIELCHuv
%       'lab' uses CIELCHab
%       'yppp' uses the maximum biconic boundary in YPbPr (HSYp)
%       'luvp' uses the maximum biconic boundary in CIELCHuv (HuSLp)
%       'labp' uses the maximum biconic boundary in CIELCHab (HuSLp)
%
%   The above LAB/LUV methods are based on lookup tables for speed on large images.  This isn't perfect, 
%   but if a direct method is desired, specify 'luvcalc' or 'labcalc'.  The direct LUV method uses a line 
%   intersection calculation for for boundary finding similar to the reference implementation of HuSL.  
%
%   The direct LAB method uses bisection and is much slower.  Due to the concavity of the R=1 face in LAB, 
%   the boundary chroma is represented as the envelope of the actual chroma near the yellow corner. 
%   The LAB bisection function will dump convergence information to the console while running.
%
%   CHANNELS parameters are specified as name-value pairs
%       for 'luvp', 'labp', and 'yppp', 'lightness' or 'luma' is required
%       for other modes, 'lightness' and 'hue' are required
%
%   EXAMPLE:
%   Cnorm=maxchroma('luv','lightness',L,'hue',H);
%   Cnorm=maxchroma('ypp','luma',Y,'hue',H);

%   The LUV method is a fairly direct adaptation of the C and Lua implementations 
%   by Alexei Boronine et al:  http://www.husl-colors.org/
%
%   The LAB method is a compromise.  Not all regions can be constrained to the extent of sRGB.  
%   Near the yellow corner, the concavity of the R==1 and G==1 faces causes them to occlude a radial 
%   cast from the neutral axis to the maximal boundary.  See file 'concavity_in_CIELAB.png'
%   In these narrow regions, OOG points can exist with normalized chroma <100%.  As the distance 
%   between these points and the face is small, any clipping error is minimal. LUV does not have this issue.
